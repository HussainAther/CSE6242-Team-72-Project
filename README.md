# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This project aims to accurately predict housing prices using machine learning models enhanced by geographic, structural, and socioeconomic data. The pipeline includes extensive data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and early UI prototyping for end-user interaction.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

We train and evaluate two powerful regression models — **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** — to predict housing prices based on features such as number of bedrooms/bathrooms, lot size, house size, city/state encodings, and more.

Key steps:
- Data cleaning and outlier removal
- Feature engineering using **target encoding** for high-cardinality fields like `city` and `state`
- Standardization of numerical features
- Model evaluation and comparison using RMSE, MSE, and R²
- Feature importance analysis and SHAP explainability (in progress)
- UI prototype for interactive price prediction
